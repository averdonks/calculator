## Reflection

This project was quite difficult to figure out, but I'm glad I persevered through to the end. This concludes my study in [the odin project foundations course](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations). Next, I plan to start a Software Engineering degree at WGU.
